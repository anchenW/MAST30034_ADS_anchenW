# Directory
_Change this to fit your needs when you have started the project._
- `raw_data`: Contains all the raw data files. You may add this folder to `.gitignore` if your files are too large, but you **must** provide code to automatically download or links so that we may manually download them. 
- `preprocessed_data`: Contains all the preprocessed data files. 
- `plots`: Output and save all figures.
- `code`: Keep all notebooks and scripts in this folder. Ensure that you have notebooks for each _stage_ of code. Here's an example:

    - step2_visualisation for "Analysis and Visualisation".
    - step3_model for "Statistical Modelling".
- `deprecated`:
